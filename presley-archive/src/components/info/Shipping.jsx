      <h3>shipping info</h3>
      <p>
        Orders are typically processed and shipped within 2-7 business days. Whether your order was placed through Instagram or Depop, you'll receive a Canada Post tracking number once your parcel has been sent out. Once your package has been handed off to Canada Post, we are not responsible for any lost or stolen parcels. If you run into any delivery issues, please contact Canada Post directly for support. Untracked lettermail parcels are agreed upon before payment, and we are not responsible for lost packages once shipped.

      <h3>return policy</h3>
      <p>
        All purchases are final sale. We kindly ask that you check all provided measurements and photos carefully before placing your order to ensure the item is right for you. As each piece is pre-loved, gentle signs of wear are to be expected. We always try our best to highlight any notable flaws in the description and photos so you know exactly what you're getting.
        If anything's unclear or you'd like to know more before purchasing, feel free to reach out via instagram or depopâ€”we're happy to answer any questions.
