                If you love vintage but don't feel like doing all the digging yourself, this is for you. Our Style Bundles are a super easy way to refresh your wardrobe with curated, one-of-a-kind pieces — no stress, no endless scrolling, just good style delivered to your door. 
            </p>
            <p>Our style bundles typically include 3 outfits using non-designer pieces thoughtfully selected to match your style, vision and size. Accessories such as sunglasses, scarves, and jewellery are included. Footwear is available via in-person styling appointments only.</p>
            <p>Smaller or larger bundles are available upon request.</p>
            <p>Please inquire via DM for pricing and shipping costs.</p>
            <p>To get started, send us a DM on instagram (presley_archive) with a Pinterest board that accurately reflects the outfits or vibes you're into, along with your measurements and clothing sizes. This helps us get a clear idea of your aesthetic and so we can pull pieces that perfectly suit you.</p>
            <p>Every bundle is totally unique and styled with care — perfect for trying something new, building your wardrobe, or treating yourself to a fun surprise.</p>
